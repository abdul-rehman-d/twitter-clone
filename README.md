# Twitter Clone

This is a Twitter Clone made with [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/). It uses tRPC for the endpoints, Next.JS as the framework as well as Prisma and Tailwind.\
This is built using following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkOSUVzOAA4) for T3 Stack by [Theo.gg](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) as the base and then is added functionality by myself.
